Fixes: [31675] Access 2010 Runtime can't load trivial database without native oleaut32
Fixes: Implement ICreateTypeLib2 DeleteTypeInfo (PR 3579)
Fixes: Correct converting a Interface (PR 8622)

With these patches, the Access database can be open but there is still other things going on which
stop it from working correctly (at least there is no crash now).
